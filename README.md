## Analysis
Questions that were expected to explore on this dataset:
What are the words being treated as useful information as customers rating the review? (i.e., What aspects of the product are most important for customers)
What are the relationships of review text/title and rating, rating and recommend IND, and review text/title and recommend IND?
Whether text or title generates more useful information to users?
Whether other listed variables (product classification information, demographic information) have potential relations to title/text? (i.e. girls may be prone to give positive reviews on T-shirt than Jeans)
Is is possible to predict with words alone whether or not a customer would recommend a purchased item of clothing?
